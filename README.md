Kanren for Erlang


This is a very partial erlang instance of miniKanren. I didn't create
it I just found it in another repo. It is not maintained and I don't
know how much of it works or how complete it is.

Unless you want to take over maintaining it or really hacking on it I
would suggest looking at https://github.com/lyons/ExKanren[ExKarnen]
For Elixir or http://github.com/rvirding/erlog[Erlog] which is prolog
to do Logic or relational programming in an Erlang project.
