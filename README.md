Kanren for Erlang


This is a very partial erlang instance of miniKanren. I didn't create
it I just found it in another repo. It is not maintained and I don't
know how much of it works or how complete it is.

Unless you want to take over maintaining it or really hacking on it I
would suggest looking at [ExKarnen](https://github.com/lyons/ExKanren)
For Elixir or [Erlog](http://github.com/rvirding/erlog) which is prolog
to do Logic or relational programming in an Erlang project.
